# Tackling-markov-decision-process-with-reinforcement-learning-methods
This experiment applies two dynamic programming approaches value and policy iteration and q learning to solve discrete markov decision process. The results are then analyzed to understand the inner workings of these approaches and how the nature of these discrete problems impact their performance.
